## 👋 About Statu

**Statu** is a self-hosted uptime monitoring solution designed for developers who want simplicity without sacrificing power. It provides real-time monitoring for your HTTP/HTTPS services, TCP ports, and Ping responses, packaged in a beautiful and responsive interface.

Unlike heavy enterprise solutions, Statu focuses on **speed, minimalism, and ease of deployment**.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Modern Dashboard:** Clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface.
- 🔔 **Instant Notifications:** Get alerted via Telegram, Discord, Slack, Email, and Webhooks when services go down.
- 📊 **Status Pages:** Public status pages to keep your users informed.
- 🐳 **Docker First:** Deploy in seconds using Docker.
- 🛡️ **Privacy Focused:** Your data stays on your server.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Statu is built with modern web technologies to ensure performance and maintainability:

- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript) / NestJS / Fastify
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL (Prisma)
- **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional, but recommended)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Dev-Emree/Statu.git](https://github.com/Dev-Emree/Statu.git)
   cd statu
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```Bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Setup Database (SQLite by default)

   ```Bash
   # Create .env from example (if any) or ensure DATABASE_URL is set
   echo 'DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"' > .env

   # Run migrations
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. Run the development server (Backend + Frontend)

   ```Bash
   # Start Backend
   npm run start:dev &

   # Start Frontend (in a separate terminal)
   npm run start:frontend
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (Frontend port may vary, check console).
